We're building **Kloe**, a modern dataflow programming platform inspired by visual programming paradigms like
LabVIEW.

## What is Kloe?

Kloe enables building applications as graphs of interconnected nodes that process data streams with automatic
parallelization. It combines:

- **Type-safe graph construction** with Kotlin DSL
- **Efficient parallel execution** using coroutines
- **Visual design capabilities** (in development)
- **Platform APIs** for remote execution
